Description: 
        # Respiration recording analysis toolbox
        
        This library provides functions to evaluate single belt chest expansion recordings of human adult respiration during passive tasks (standing still, sitting and listening to music, etc.) It includes features to find and describe features of individual breaths and to evaluate important phases of the respiratory cycle.
        
        Developed by Finn Upham 2021 
        
        This is not suitable for the evaluation of respiration during high intensity excertions, or for non-human animals, or for respiration measurements taken with other types of sensors (flow meters, double belts).
        
        This toolbox is written in python 3.0.9 with the following dependencies:
        import time
        import datetime as dt
        import math
        import numpy as np 
        import pandas as pd
        from scipy.signal import butter,filtfilt
        from scipy import interpolate
        from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
        
        TODO add versions, format like an adult
